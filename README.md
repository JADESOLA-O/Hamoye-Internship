# Hamoye-Internship
During my internship, I focused on data analysis, preprocessing, and model evaluation to derive insights and predictions from a given dataset. The project workflow began with an in-depth exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and trends, identify imbalances, and assess data quality. Following this, I conducted data preprocessing, which included cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and adjusting data types to ensure consistency across features. 
Once the data was prepared, I moved on to data splitting. I divided the dataset into training and testing sets to facilitate model validation, using an 80-20 split to balance training accuracy and generalizability. To standardize the feature scales, I applied normalization techniques, particularly MinMaxScaler, which scaled all features between 0 and 1, crucial for maintaining uniformity, especially for models sensitive to feature scales. 
Finally, the evaluation process employed various metrics to measure model performance, including accuracy, precision, and recall. The results provided key insights into model effectiveness, and the detailed code and explanations for each of these steps can be found in my
